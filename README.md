# Welcome to the proc_structural tutorial
### Structural processing tutorial - from pre-processing to plotting

In this repository we will go over how to run preprocesing for structural MRI data using **Micapipe**. 
### Micapipe is a full neuroimaging pipeline from the MICA-lab that automatically preprocesses structural, functional, and diffusion MRI to generate high-quality, standardized connectomes. 
*Full documentation is available here:* 🔗 https://micapipe.readthedocs.io


The tutorials here are designed to direct ypu to the infromation you need in order to understand and run your preprocessing pipeline. We will go throught how to:
* Build your own proc_struct command line
* How to work with supermachine clusters
* Cortical thickness analysis and plotting 

 ### *Beginner Helpbook: covering basics behind the preprocessing. https://docs.google.com/document/d/124vj8qcqMOPo08Vdr2WBnE_DB4Gj52aAv_VVVzE9dLE/edit?usp=sharing*
 in this file you will find fundamentals in order to absorb the information on running the proc_structural better.
